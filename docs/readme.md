# Gated MXR Envelope Filter Effects Pedal

This is a clone of the original MXR effects pedal. 

Note that the board layout has been designed so that all mechanical components are PCB mounted. No rats nest!
A separate "auxilary" board is used to mount the potentiometer controls. This allows smaller (shorter) pots to be used and also increases the PCB real estate for the effect chain sections of the circuit.

A tremolo effect is added to gate the envelope filter. Note the ground plane on the back of the layout has been specifcally designed to prevent noise on the output signal.  i.e. the ground plane has been removed for digital portions of the circuit.
