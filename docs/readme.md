# Gated MXR Envelope Filter Effects Pedal

This is a clone of the original MXR effects pedal. 

Note that the board layout has been designed so that all mechanical components are PCB mounted. No rats nest!

A separate "auxilary" board is used to mount the potentiometer controls. This is in turn, mounted onto the main PCB. This allows smaller (shorter) pots to be used and also increases the PCB real estate for the effect chain sections of the circuit.

A tremolo effect is added to gate the envelope filter. Unlike the original UHF clock, this additional LFO clock is audible and can generate output signal noise. To prevent this output signal contamination, the ground plane has been removed for digital portions of the circuit.
